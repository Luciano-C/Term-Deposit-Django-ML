                <p class="text-start read-more-paragraph mt-3">CapitalCall is an app that uses a machine learning model to
                    analyze client data and make predictions about their likelihood of taking a term deposit. The model
                    takes into account various factors such as demographic information, financial history, and previous
                    banking behavior. By considering these factors, the model can accurately predict the likelihood of a
                    client taking a term deposit when contacted.
                </p>

                <h2 class="read-more-title">Which model is used?</h2>
                <p class="text-start read-more-paragraph mt-3">CapitalCall uses a Logistic Regression model, which is a type
                    of statistical model used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to
                    predict a binary outcome (e.g. yes/no, true/false, 1/0). <br>
                    Logistic Regression models the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more
                    independent variables by using a logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. The logistic
                    function maps any real-valued number to the range of 0 to 1, which can be interpreted as a
                    probability. <br>

                    In logistic regression, the parameters of the model are estimated using maximum likelihood
                    estimation, which involves finding the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood of
                    observing the data given the model. Once the parameters have been estimated, the model can be used
                    to make predictions for new data points. <br>

                    One of the advantages of logistic regression is that it can handle both continuous and categorical
                    independent variables. Additionally, it is easy to interpret the coefficients of the model, as they
                    represent the change in the log-odds of the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent
                    variable, holding all other variables constant. This makes logistic regression a useful tool for
                    identifying the most important predictors of a binary outcome.

                <p class="text-start read-more-paragraph mt-3">
                    A bank dataset from a previous marketing campaign was used which contains the following:<br>
